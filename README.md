# Compilation of Small Projects

Welcome to my personal playground! This repository is a collection of small projects, websites, and games I created while learning different programming languages. Some of them run perfectly, others... not so much.😅

## Project List
- **Drive File Link** – A simple readme with a link to my Google Drive.
- **Whack-A-Mole** – A classic mini-game project.

## Languages Used
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Java 
- HTML 
- CSS 
- JavaScript 
- Python 

## Status
Some projects are complete, some are still a work in progress. I use this repo as a sandbox to test and learn.
