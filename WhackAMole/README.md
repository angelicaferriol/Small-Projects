## About

This game was built with the help of Kenny Yip Coding Tutorial in YouTube. I only added few additional changes and features of the game including multiple plants, reset button, and high score tracker.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
